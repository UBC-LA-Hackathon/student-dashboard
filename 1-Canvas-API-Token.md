## Create env file in backend.
1. Create a `.env` file inside the `backend` folder. It's easiest to create this file using a code editor like [VSCode](https://code.visualstudio.com/).
![env](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/8836578/72940819-7873c400-3d67-11ea-8184-97c8cea5b523.png)
1. Copy the snippet below into `.env`.
    ```
    CANVAS_API_TOKEN=
    CANVAS_API_DOMAIN=https://ubc.instructure.com/api/v1
    ```
1. In the next step, we'll create a token and paste it in the `CANVAS_API_TOKEN=` field.

## Generate your Canvas access token
1. Log into Canvas at [canvas.ubc.ca](http://canvas.ubc.ca/). Click _Account_ in the left menu, and then click _Settings_.
![Setting](https://learninganalytics.ubc.ca/files/2019/05/Screen-Shot-2019-05-22-at-3.25.40-PM.png)
1. Scroll to _Approved Integration_ and click _+ New Access Token_.
![New Access Token](https://learninganalytics.ubc.ca/files/2019/05/Screen-Shot-2019-05-22-at-3.26.33-PM.png)
1. Fill in the _Purpose_ field. For added security, set an expiry date for your token. This way, if you accidentally share your token or your token is stolen, at the very least it wonâ€™t be valid forever.
1. Click _Generate Token_. Now copy your freshly generated token.
1. In the `.env`, `CANVAS_API_TOKEN={Paste your token here}`
1. Save `.env`.

> Never share your token with anyone. If you think your token may have been exposed (for example, by accidentally posting it to GitHub), delete your token from Canvas right away. Instructions for creating and deleting access tokens as a student are [available on the Canvas Guides](https://community.canvaslms.com/docs/DOC-16005-42121018197).

## Start the server
1. Type `npm start` into terminal in `backend` directory. If your server is already running, kill it first: `control + c`, then start the server. If you see any strange error messages, you might have forgotten to install dependencies using `npm install`.
1. Navigate to http://localhost:4001/.

You should see a `Hello World!` displayed.

## Create an API call to Canvas from within `server.js`
_Not sure what an API (application programming interface) is? [Here's a guide.](https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/what-is-an-api-in-english-please-b880a3214a82/)_

To ensure that you are able to make API calls to Canvas, let's create a call and print the result.

Navigate to `server.js` in `backend` folder, and you'll see the following line:

```js
const canvasAPI = require('node-canvas-api')
```

This line imports a Canvas API object that comes with a [bunch of useful functions](https://github.com/ubccapico/node-canvas-api/tree/master/src). The one we want to use is the simplest: `getSelf`. This returns information about the person who makes the request.

So add the following line below `// Make API call to Canvas API here `:

```js
canvasAPI.getSelf()
  .then(self => console.log(self))
```

Once you save the file, the server will automatically restart.

You should receive response back that looks something like this printed in the terminal:
```js
{
  id: 50,
  name: 'Justin Lee',
  created_at: '2017-07-12T10:38:49-07:00',
  sortable_name: 'Lee, Justin',
  short_name: 'Justin Lee',
  avatar_url: 'https://ubc.instructure.com/images/messages/avatar-50.png',
  locale: null,
  effective_locale: 'en-CA',
  permissions: { can_update_name: false, can_update_avatar: true }
}
```
