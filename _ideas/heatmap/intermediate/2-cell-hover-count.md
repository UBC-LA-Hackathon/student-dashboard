## Heatmap - Intermediate

## Task
When a cell in the heatmap is hovered, display a count of the number of posts.

## Overview
To display a count on hover, you'll need to use D3's  to the heatmap cells. You may find [this guide](https://medium.com/@kj_schmidt/show-data-on-mouse-over-with-d3-js-3bf598ff8fc2) helpful.

## Steps
1. Add `mouseover` and `mouseout` events to the cells. 
1. Create a function to append the text of the `count` value of the hovered cell. 
1. Create a function to remove the text when the cell is no longer hovered.
