## Good work!
Good for you on making it this far! Since you have a lot of time remaining, try to build something a little bit more complex. We've provided data and some ideas to get you started.

## Give me data!
TODO: Add links to data

* [Course calendar data (CSV)](): contains information about all the courses offered at UBC from 2014-2019.
* [Degree requirements data (CSV)](): contains degree requirement data (co-reqs/pre-reqs, etc).
* [Grade distribution data (CSV)](): contains grade distribution data of courses at UBC.
* [Canvas activity API (JSON)](): provides your own activity data from Canvas.

You can use [`readCSV.js`](./backend/readCSV.js) to read the CSVs into the server.

## Give me ideas!

### Heatmap
Let's create some additional features for the heatmap.

#### Intermediate
1. Add a legend to the heatmap showing how many posts each shade of blue represents.
1. When a cell in the heatmap is hovered, display a count of the number of posts.
1. Create a date range selector that will filter the data so that the heatmap displays only the data that fits within the specified date range.
1. Aggregate discussion from all of your courses instead of one course.
1. Create a way to show switch between showing just TA/Instructor posts and all posts.

#### Advanced
1. When a cell in the heatmap is hovered or clicked, show the discussions that were posted at that date and time.
1. Create a calendar view so that it is possible to navigate between weeks/months.
1. Create a filter that allows users to select a specific individual to see when they post.
1. Run text/sentiment analysis on the discussion posts and use this data to create a heatmap.

### Create something new
Don't want to build new features for the heatmap? That's okay!

TODO: Any more data?

#### Intermediate
1. Create a degree planning tool that shows students what courses they are eligible to register for, given a list of courses in Canvas students have completed and the [degree requirments data (CSV)](TODO: LINK)
